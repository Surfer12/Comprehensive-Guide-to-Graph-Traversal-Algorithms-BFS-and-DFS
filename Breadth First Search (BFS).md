Breadth First Search (BFS)

# Breadth-First Search for Graphs

## Introduction
Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores a graph level by level. It starts at a given source 
node and visits all its neighbors. Then, it visits their unvisited neighbors, and so on. BFS is often used to find the 
shortest path between two nodes in an unweighted graph.

## Graph Representation
Graphs can be represented using adjacency matrices or adjacency lists.
* Adjacency Matrix: A 2D array where matrix[i][j] is 1 if there's an edge between nodes i and j, and 0 otherwise.
* Adjacency List: An array of lists where list[i] contains the neighbors of node i.

## BFS Algorithm
public void breadthFirstSearch(List<List<Integer>> adjList, int source) {
   boolean[] visited = new boolean[adjList.size()];
   Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
   visited[source] = true;
   queue.offer(source);

   while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
       int node = queue.poll();
       System.out.print(node + " ");

       for (int neighbor : adjList.get(node)) {
           if (!visited[neighbor]) {
               visited[neighbor] = true;
               queue.offer(neighbor);
           }
       }
   }
}



## Path Traversal in BFS
BFS naturally yields a breadth-first traversal of paths. To record and later traverse these paths, we can store the parent 
of each node during the search.
// Example: Pre-order traversal of a path from source to target
public void preOrderPathTraversal(int source, int target, int[] parent) {
   if (target == source) {
       System.out.print(source + " ");
       return;
   }
   preOrderPathTraversal(source, parent[target], parent);
   System.out.print(target + " ");
}

## Complexity Analysis

The time and space complexity of the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm can be analyzed based on the following variables:

- **V (Vertices)**: This represents the number of nodes (or vertices) in the graph. Each node is a point in the graph where edges can connect to other nodes.

- **E (Edges)**: This denotes the number of edges in the graph. An edge is a connection between two vertices, which can be directed or undirected depending on the graph's structure.


- **Iterative BFS**: This method uses a queue to explore each vertex's neighbors before moving deeper into the graph.
- **Recursive BFS**: This method simulates the BFS process using a list as a queue. It processes the current vertex and recursively calls itself with the updated queue.


## Comparison and Selection Guidelines of BFS to DFS

### Time and Space Complexity
- Both DFS and BFS: O(V + E) time complexity
- DFS: O(h) space complexity (h = height of tree/graph)
- BFS: O(w) space complexity (w = maximum width of tree/graph)

### Selection Criteria
Choose DFS when:
- Memory is limited
- Solution is far from root
- Need to detect cycles
- Implementing backtracking algorithms


Choose BFS when:
- Finding shortest path
- Solution is close to root
- Level-order traversal needed
- Testing bipartiteness

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of BFS is **O(V + E)**. This is because:
- Each vertex is processed once when it is dequeued from the queue, contributing **O(V)** to the time complexity.
- Each edge is examined once when traversing the adjacency list or matrix, contributing **O(E)** to the time complexity.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity of BFS is **O(V)**. This is due to:
- The `visited` array, which keeps track of whether each vertex has been visited. This array requires space proportional to the number of vertices, **O(V)**.
- The queue used to store the vertices that need to be processed also requires space proportional to the number of vertices in the worst case, which is also **O(V)**.

In summary, the overall complexity of BFS is efficient for traversing graphs, making it suitable for various applications, especially in unweighted graphs where finding the shortest path is essential.

## BFS is used in various applications, including:
* Finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.
* Network routing protocols.
* Web crawlers.
* Social network analysis.
For efficient implementation, consider using an adjacency list for sparse graphs and optimizing queue operations.

## BFS prioritizes exploring nodes level by level. Imagine searching a maze by exploring all immediate paths from your starting
point, then all paths one step further, and so on.

## General Implementation Pseudo Code
1. Start at the root node (for trees) or a designated starting node (for graphs).
2. Add the starting node to a queue.
3. While the queue is not empty:
   * Dequeue a node from the queue.
   * Mark the node as visited.
   * Enqueue all unvisited neighbors of the node.

## BFS in Java (using a Queue):
public void bfs(Node root) {
   if (root == null) {
       return;
   }
   Queue<Node> queue = new LinkedList<>();
   queue.offer(root);

   while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
       Node node = queue.poll();
       System.out.print(node.data + " "); // Process the node

       if (node.left != null) {
           queue.offer(node.left);
       }
       if (node.right != null) {
           queue.offer(node.right);
       }
   }
}

## BFS with Adjacency Matrix and Adjacency List (for Graphs):
 BFS with Adjacency Matrix
public void bfsMatrix(int[][] matrix, int startNode) {
   boolean[] visited = new boolean[matrix.length];
   Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
   visited[startNode] = true;
   queue.offer(startNode);

   while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
       int node = queue.poll();
       System.out.print(node + " ");

       for (int i = 0; i < matrix[node].length; i++) {
           if (matrix[node][i] == 1 && !visited[i]) {
               visited[i] = true;
               queue.offer(i);
           }
       }
   }
}

## BFS with Adjacency List
public void bfsList(List<List<Integer>> adjList, int startNode) {
   boolean[] visited = new boolean[adjList.size()];
   Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
   visited[startNode] = true;
   queue.offer(startNode);

   while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
       int node = queue.poll();
       System.out.print(node + " ");

       for (int neighbor : adjList.get(node)) {
           if (!visited[neighbor]) {
               visited[neighbor] = true;
               queue.offer(neighbor);
           }
       }
   }
}


##Implementation Approaches for Iterative BFS and Recursive BFS


### Iterative BFS
```java
// ... existing code ...
public void bfsIterative(int startVertex) {
    boolean[] visited = new boolean[vertices];
    Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
    
    visited[startVertex] = true;
    queue.offer(startVertex);
    
    while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
        int vertex = queue.poll();
        System.out.print(vertex + " ");
        
        for (int adjacent : adjacencyList.get(vertex)) {
            if (!visited[adjacent]) {
                visited[adjacent] = true;
                queue.offer(adjacent);
            }
        }
    }
}
// .
```

### Recursive BFS
```java
// ... existing code ...
public void bfsRecursive(int startVertex) {
    boolean[] visited = new boolean[vertices];
    List<Integer> queue = new ArrayList<>();
    
    queue.add(startVertex);
    bfsRecursiveUtil(queue, visited);
}

private void bfsRecursiveUtil(List<Integer> queue, boolean[] visited) {
    if (queue.isEmpty()) return;

    int vertex = queue.remove(0);
    System.out.print(vertex + " ");
    visited[vertex] = true;

    for (int adjacent : adjacencyList.get(vertex)) {
        if (!visited[adjacent]) {
            visited[adjacent] = true;
            queue.add(adjacent);
        }
    }
    
    bfsRecursiveUtil(queue, visited);
}
// ... existing code ...
```


* Applications beyond shortest paths: While BFS excels at finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs, its level-by-level
exploration is valuable in other scenarios:
   * Finding connected components: BFS can identify all nodes reachable from a starting node, effectively grouping connected
components in a graph.
   * Testing bipartiteness: BFS can determine if a graph is bipartite (can be colored with two colors such that no adjacent
nodes have the same color).
   * Crawling web pages: Search engines often use a modified BFS approach to crawl web pages, starting from a seed page and
following links level by level.
* Variations and optimizations:
   * Bidirectional BFS: When searching for a path between two specific nodes, you can run two BFS searches simultaneously,
one from each node, potentially finding the path faster.
   * Parallel BFS: For large graphs, BFS can be parallelized to explore multiple branches concurrently, speeding up the
search.

## Depth-First Search (DFS) - Further Exploration
* Applications beyond cycle detection: DFS is versatile and finds use in various graph problems:
   * Topological sorting: In directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), DFS can order nodes such that for every directed edge from node
A to node B, A appears before B in the ordering.
   * Finding strongly connected components: In directed graphs, DFS can identify groups of nodes where every node is
reachable from every other node within the group.
   * Solving puzzles with backtracking: DFS is the backbone of backtracking algorithms, used to explore possible solutions
in problems like Sudoku and the N-Queens puzzle.
* Variations and optimizations:
   * Iterative deepening DFS: Combines the space efficiency of DFS with the completeness of BFS by performing depth-limited
DFS searches with increasing depth limits.
   * DFS with pruning: In problem-solving scenarios, DFS can be optimized by pruning branches that are guaranteed not to
lead to a solution.

## Comparing BFS and DFS
* Memory usage: DFS generally uses less memory than BFS, especially in deep graphs, as it only needs to store the nodes
along the current path. BFS, on the other hand, stores all nodes at the current level, which can be memory-intensive for
wide graphs.
* Speed: The relative speed of BFS and DFS depends on the graph structure and the problem being solved. If the solution is
likely to be found at shallower depths, BFS might be faster. If the solution is deep within the graph or requires exploring
a specific path, DFS might be more efficient.

## Choosing the right algorithm
The choice between BFS and DFS depends on the specific application and the characteristics of the graph:
* Shortest path: BFS is generally preferred for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.
* Connectivity: Both BFS and DFS can be used to find connected components, but BFS might be slightly easier to implement.
* Cycle detection: DFS is typically used for cycle detection.
* Topological sorting: DFS is necessary for topological sorting.
* Memory constraints: If memory is a concern, DFS is generally more memory-efficient.
