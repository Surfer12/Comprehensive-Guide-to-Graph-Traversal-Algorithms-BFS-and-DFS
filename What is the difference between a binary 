What is the difference between a binary tree and a binary search tree?

Binary tree is not necessarily sorted an ascending order like a binary search tree is when it is traversed in a specific order. A binary search tree's name Contains the term binary search, which is a search algorithm that searches within a sorted type of data with a time complexity of O(log n). A binary search tree is a binary tree that is sorted in ascending order and has a time complexity of O(log n) for search operations as well.
